# Arch Linux Packages

A collection of all the Arch Linux packages I maintain, currently AUR packages only.

Should be identical to https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=yuvadm

Feel free to open issues/PRs in this repository for fixes to be merged into the AUR.

## Usage

Use the `pkg.sh` wrapper script to run the common commands:

```bash
$ ./pkg.sh add pkgname
$ ./pkg.sh update pkgname
```
